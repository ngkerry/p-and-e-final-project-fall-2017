# Arduino powered Pong Game

For this final Programming & Electronics class, I built a mini arduino powered "Pong" game and a mini arcade machine for it. 

## Summary

Here, write a paragraph or two describing what you built for your final project and what was challenging. 

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

By building a small version of “Pong” I'm attempting to paytribute to one of the first arcade video games that helped establish the video game industry and it’s very important in th e complex history of Interaction Design. “Pong” was originally manufactured by Atari in 1972 and created by Allan Alcorn.  As an Interaction Design student, I want to recreate this game and also build a model for it. Using what I’ve learned in this class and using my model-making skills, this project could be a perfect combination of physical and digital components. 



## Component Parts

From what pieces did you build your project?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

* Pieces I will buy or have already:
* -Arduino Uno, Mini or Mega (input/output)
* -A 0.96” Color OLED Display
* -A breadboard
* -Two buttons
* -wires 
* 
* Parts I’m building: 
* -An small arcade machine made out thin wood that I will laser cut, and paint with spray paint and by hand. 
* -All the components for the “Pong” game will go on the inside of the mini arcade machine. The mini arcade machine will have windows to display the 0.96” Color OLED Display and the two buttons. 

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

* What did you do in each of the past five weeks?
* 
* Week 1: Write proposal.
* Week 2: buy all materials and parts I’ll use. 
* Week 3: write the code, connect all wires, make sure everything works perfectly, test with people. 
* Week 4: laser cut wood to build mini arcade model, paint model. 
* Week 5: Present!
