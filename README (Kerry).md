# Arduino powered Pong Game

For my Programming & Electronics final project, I built a mini Arduino powered Pong Game and a mini arcade machine as its vessel.  

## Summary

I built a small version of the classic “Pong” game as my way of paying tribute to one of the first arcade video games that helped establish the video game industry that's also very important in the long history of Interaction Design. “Pong” was originally manufactured by Atari in 1972 and created by Allan Alcorn. As an Interaction Design student, I loved the idea of making this game in particular using Arduino and also building a mini arcade machine for it. I also thought that building a mini arcade was necessary to complete the player’s experience/interaction. I feel like without it, the experience/interaction would not feel as complete and as fun. I used what I’ve learned in this class and what I’ve learned in my prototyping and model-making classes to build this game. This project is a perfect combination of physical and digital prototyping, which made the project even more fun. I though it would be a great idea to build a physical game for my classmates to play with and feel nostalgic. It was definitely fun to see people react so happily while playing the game when I play-tested with people at the hybrid lab during the weekend before the project was due. It was an interactive experience because people were able to not only see and appreciate but also hold, touch, play, and have fun with. 

## Component Parts

	•	-an Arduino Uno connected to the small breadboard and to my computer through a cable. 
	•	-A 0.96” Color OLED Display connected to the small breadboard and the Arduino. 
	•	-A small breadboard  connected to the Arduino Uno. 
	•	-Two arcade buttons connected to the small breadboard, to the OLED Display and the 
Arduino Uno. 
	•	-made-from-scratch white wires.  
	•	-A small arcade machine made out of black chip-board and glue.

## Challenges

I had some trouble with some unwanted glitch art showing up on the display I bought. I wasn’t sure if the problem had to do with the code, bad wires, or that the display itself was damaged. Either way, I ordered a new display (which hasn’t arrived yet), tested the wires again and again, used different wires, tried using different displays, and played with the code a lot. Nothing seemed to work until I switched all the wires with wires I made myself, sort of starting from scratch. After doing this, the display still showed some glitches after 5 minutes of playing the game but at least it didn’t have as many glitches as the previous game. In the end, the game worked properly, the glitches were almost non-existent, and people seemed to have fun playing it. Plus, some thought the mini arcade machine was a cute addition to the game. 

## Timeline

I’m an AD/HDer so, I didn’t quite follow the schedule I set for myself. Let's just say that I spent a lot of time in the hybrid lab trying to figure out what was making the display show unsolicited glitch art. I prayed to make it work by the time the project was due. I also waited impatiently for banggood.com to deliver me a new display, but didn’t arrive soon enough to replace it for the final project. From week 1 to week 2 I bought the materials, connected everything to everything, and built the game. From week 3 to 5, I was working on figuring out what was causing the glitches, got rid of them, play-tested, and built the mini arcade machine once the game was entirely functional.
